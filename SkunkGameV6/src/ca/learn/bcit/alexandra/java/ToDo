To Do
The score still adds a bit too much for the computer.

Draw a board showing the player's score and the computer's score each round
Account for triple rolls

print each roll's score on the board?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done

Must reset the score each round

Am I saving the player and computer's score per round to then add at the end?
Must show:
"Round #1 Results"
"Your score: "
"Computer score: "

Plus at the end must show
"Game Results"
"Your score: "
"Computer score: "



print "round #1"


Must enable multiple dice to be rolled
After v18, I am enabling multiple dice. Before that, the game worked fine.

Must account for a complete game ending if the dice rolled is a 1,1 - hard to test but probably done.

"You win this round." not ending the game on a 1 roll

Must make a total score because right now it is getting reset each round 

Next I must make a Round class to make a new round each time.
int[] skunkRounds = new int[6];
for (int i: skunkRounds)
{
	GameController = new GameController;
	
}

Put the Main class's functionality into a Round
Make a GameController to loop through multiple rounds

Next I must add a condition if the player and computer both locked their points
Then the round must end
So the areAllStanding will be set to false to end the round and break the loop
